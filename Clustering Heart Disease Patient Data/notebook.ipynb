Targeting treatment for heart disease patients\n<p>There are many industries where understanding how things group together is beneficial. For example, retailers want to understand the similarities among their customers to direct advertisement campaigns, and botanists classify plants based on their shared similar characteristics. One way to group objects is to use clustering algorithms. We are going to explore the usefulness of unsupervised clustering algorithms to help doctors understand which treatments might work with their patients.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_552/img/images-3.jpeg\" alt></p>\n<p>We are going to cluster anonymized data of patients who have been diagnosed with heart disease. Patients with similar characteristics might respond to the same treatments, and doctors could benefit from learning about the treatment outcomes of patients like those they are treating.

Comparing clustering results\n<p>The doctors are interested in grouping similar patients together to determine appropriate treatments. Therefore, they want clusters with more than a few patients to see different treatment options. While a patient can be in a cluster by themselves, this means that the treatment they received might not be recommended for someone else in the group. </p>\n<p>Like the k-means algorithm, the way to evaluate hierarchical clusters is to investigate which patients are grouped together. Are there patterns evident in the cluster assignments, or do they seem to be groups of noise? We're going to examine the clusters resulting from the two hierarchical algorithms. </p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"53"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Add assignment of chosen hierarchical linkage\n# ....

Conclusion\n<p>Now that we've tried multiple clustering algorithms, it is necessary to determine if we think any of them will work for clustering our patients. For the k-means algorithm, similar clusters must be produced for each iteration of the algorithm to make sure that the algorithm clusters the signal, not the noise. </p>\n<p>For the sake of the doctors, we also want to have multiple patients in each group so they can compare treatments. We only did some preliminary work to explore the performance of the algorithms, and it is necessary to explore further before making a recommendation. Based on the above analysis, are there any algorithms that you would want to investigate further to group patients? </p>\n<p>Remember that it is important the k-mean algorithm seems stable when running multiple iterations. This means that we would see similar groups of patients showing up in the plots from the different iterations of the algorithm. For the hierarchical clustering, we need a method that puts a balanced number of patients in each group. </p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"67"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Add TRUE if the algorithm shows promise, add FALSE if it does not\nexplore_kmeans <- FALSE\nexplore_hierarch_complete <- TRUE\nexplore_hierarch_single <- FALSE","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"ir","display_name":"R","language":"R"},"language_info":{"name":"R","codemirror_mode":"r","pygments_lexer":"r","mimetype":"text/x-r-source","file_extension":".r","version":"3.5.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
